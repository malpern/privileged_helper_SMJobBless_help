# SMJobBless Privileged Helper - macOS Implementation

**Goal**: Create a working privileged helper using the legacy SMJobBless API as an alternative to the problematic SMAppService on macOS 15.

## Project Status: âœ… **Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing**

This repository implements a complete SMJobBless privileged helper solution:
1. âœ… **Xcode project** with app + helper targets built successfully  
2. âœ… **SwiftUI interface** with Install/Test/Uninstall buttons
3. âœ… **SMJobBless integration** using Authorization Services framework
4. âœ… **XPC communication** between app and helper with proper protocols
5. âœ… **Code signing** configured with manual signing (Apple Development)
6. ðŸ”„ **Ready for functional testing** on macOS 15 Sequoia

## Background

This project was created after comprehensive testing showed SMAppService consistently fails with Error 108 on macOS 15, despite perfect configuration. After systematic elimination of all configuration possibilities in the [previous SMAppService attempt](https://github.com/malpern/privileged_helper_help), we're pivoting to the legacy but stable SMJobBless API.


## What's Implemented

- âœ… **Complete Xcode project** with app + helper targets in `SMJobBlessApp/`
- âœ… **SMJobBless registration** using Authorization Services framework
- âœ… **XPC communication** between app and helper with proper protocols  
- âœ… **SwiftUI interface** for installing, testing, and managing the helper
- âœ… **Helper validation** that confirms root privileges and performs test operations
- âœ… **Code signing** configured with Team ID X2RKZ5TG99 (Apple Development)
- âœ… **Build system** working with manual signing to bypass provisioning conflicts

## Technical Achievements

### **Key Issues Resolved:**
- **Provisioning Profile Conflicts**: Service management entitlement incompatible with automatic provisioning  
- **Swift Compilation**: Fixed deprecated `AuthorizationFlags.defaults` and unsafe pointer usage
- **Code Signing**: Manual signing with Apple Development identity bypasses provisioning issues
- **XcodeBuild MCP**: Command-line debugging essential for identifying precise build failures

### **Development Tools Used:**
- **XcodeBuild MCP Server**: Real-time compilation feedback and error identification
- **Manual Code Signing**: Bypassed Apple's provisioning profile conflicts
- **Swift 5.0**: Updated Authorization Services usage for modern Swift

## Testing Status

Ready for functional testing:
1. âœ… **Project builds successfully** (both app and helper targets)
2. ðŸ”„ **Helper installation** (pending verification)  
3. ðŸ”„ **XPC communication** (pending verification)
4. ðŸ”„ **Privilege validation** (pending verification)
