# SMJobBless Privileged Helper - macOS Implementation

**Goal**: Create a working privileged helper using the legacy SMJobBless API as an alternative to the problematic SMAppService on macOS 15.

## Project Status: âœ… **Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Testing**

This repository implements a complete SMJobBless privileged helper solution:
1. âœ… **Xcode project** with app + helper targets created
2. âœ… **SwiftUI interface** with Install/Test/Uninstall buttons
3. âœ… **SMJobBless integration** using Authorization Services
4. âœ… **XPC communication** between app and helper
5. ðŸ”§ **Ready for testing** on macOS 15 Sequoia

## Background

This project was created after comprehensive testing showed SMAppService consistently fails with Error 108 on macOS 15, despite perfect configuration. After systematic elimination of all configuration possibilities in the [previous SMAppService attempt](https://github.com/malpern/privileged_helper_help), we're pivoting to the legacy but stable SMJobBless API.

**Previous Attempt**: [privileged_helper_help](https://github.com/malpern/privileged_helper_help) - Documents the SMAppService failure with detailed analysis and multiple fix attempts that all resulted in persistent Error 108 "Unable to read plist" on macOS 15 Sequoia.

## What's Implemented

- âœ… **Complete Xcode project** with app + helper targets in `SMJobBlessApp/`
- âœ… **SMJobBless registration** using Authorization Services framework
- âœ… **XPC communication** between app and helper with proper protocols
- âœ… **SwiftUI interface** for installing, testing, and managing the helper
- âœ… **Helper validation** that confirms root privileges and performs test operations
- ðŸ”§ **Ready for code signing** and production testing

## Next Steps

1. Update Team ID in Info.plist files (`YOUR_TEAM_ID` placeholder)
2. Configure code signing in Xcode with valid Developer ID
3. Build and test on macOS 15 Sequoia
4. Validate SMJobBless works without Error 108
