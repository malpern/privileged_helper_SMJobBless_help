### Challenge Description

We're implementing SMJobBless privileged helper functionality as an alternative to the failing SMAppService on macOS 15. Despite systematic fixes to all known configuration issues, we're stuck on `CFErrorDomainLaunchd error 2` during helper installation.

### Current State Summary

**What Works:**
- ✅ Authorization dialog appears and user can authenticate successfully
- ✅ Helper binary (165KB) is correctly embedded at `Contents/Library/LaunchServices/Helper`
- ✅ launchd.plist is properly embedded in Helper binary as `__TEXT __launchd_plist` section
- ✅ SMPrivilegedExecutables section exists in main app's Info.plist with correct code signing requirements
- ✅ Both app and helper are signed with matching Team ID (X2RKZ5TG99)

**What's Failing:**
- ❌ SMJobBless() call returns false and sets CFError to "CFErrorDomainLaunchd error 2"
- ❌ Helper bundle identifier mismatch: Expected `com.keypath.helperpoc.helper`, Actual `Helper`

### Technical Deep Dive

**Configuration Verification:**
```
Main App: com.keypath.helperpoc.SMJobBlessApp (Team: X2RKZ5TG99)
Helper Expected: com.keypath.helperpoc.helper  
Helper Actual: Helper (Team: X2RKZ5TG99)

SMPrivilegedExecutables["com.keypath.helperpoc.helper"] = "identifier \"com.keypath.helperpoc.helper\" and anchor apple generic..."
SMAuthorizedClients[0] = "identifier \"com.keypath.helperpoc.SMJobBlessApp\" and anchor apple generic..."
```

**Code Path:**
1. User clicks "Install Helper" in SwiftUI
2. Authorization succeeds → user enters admin password
3. `SMJobBless(kSMDomainSystemLaunchd, "com.keypath.helperpoc.helper" as CFString, authRef, &error)` 
4. Returns false with CFErrorDomainLaunchd error 2

### Top Hypothesis

**Primary Theory**: Bundle identifier mismatch is the root cause. SMJobBless is looking for a helper with identifier `com.keypath.helperpoc.helper` but finds one signed as `Helper`. 

**Supporting Evidence:**
- We attempted to set `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = "com.keypath.helperpoc.helper"` in Helper target
- Change didn't take effect in final binary (still shows `Identifier=Helper` in codesign output)
- Command line tools might have different bundle ID handling than app targets

**Secondary Theory**: There's an additional SMJobBless requirement we haven't discovered, such as:
- Specific entitlements needed for the Helper binary itself
- macOS 15-specific changes to SMJobBless validation
- Code signing requirement mismatch (our strings use "anchor apple generic" but maybe need "anchor apple")

### Questions for Senior Developer

1. **Bundle ID Configuration**: For a command-line tool target in Xcode, what's the correct way to set a reverse-DNS bundle identifier? Should we be using `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY`, or something else?

2. **SMJobBless Debugging**: Is there a way to get more detailed error information from SMJobBless beyond CFErrorDomainLaunchd error 2? Console logs, system logs, or debug flags?

3. **Validation Tools**: Apple's SMJobBlessUtil.py is mentioned in documentation but we don't have access. Are there alternative tools to validate SMJobBless configuration comprehensively?

4. **Modern macOS Considerations**: Are there known changes in macOS 15 (Sequoia) that affect SMJobBless behavior? Should we be using different APIs or approaches?

5. **Code Signing Requirements**: Our SMPrivilegedExecutables uses "anchor apple generic" - is this still correct for modern macOS, or should it be "anchor apple" or include additional certificate requirements?

6. **Alternative Approach**: Given SMAppService fails and SMJobBless is problematic, is there a recommended modern approach for privileged operations on macOS 15?

### Files to Review

- `/SMJobBlessApp/SMJobBlessApp/ContentView.swift:142` - SMJobBless call site
- `/SMJobBlessApp/SMJobBlessApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Build configuration (search for Helper target)
- Console.app logs during helper installation attempt

### Request for Next Agent

Please analyze the bundle identifier configuration issue first, then suggest debugging approaches for the SMJobBless failure. Feel free to challenge any of my assumptions or suggest completely different approaches.
